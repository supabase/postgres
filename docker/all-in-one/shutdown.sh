# This script provides a method of shutting down the machine/container when the database has been idle
#  for a certain amount of time (configurable via the MAX_IDLE_TIME_MINUTES env var)
#
# It checks for any active (non-idle) connections and for any connections which have been idle for more than MAX_IDLE_TIME_MINUTES.
# If there are no active connections and no idle connections, it then checks if the last disconnection event happened more than MAX_IDLE_TIME_MINUTES ago.
# 
# If all of these conditions are met, then Postgres is shut down, allowing it to wrap up any pending transactions (such as WAL shippipng) and gracefully exit.
# To terminate the machine/container, a SIGTERM signal is sent to the top-level process (supervisord) which will then shut down all other processes and exit.
