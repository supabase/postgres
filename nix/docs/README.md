# Documentation

This directory contains most of the "runbooks" and documentation on how to use
this repository.

You probably want to start with the [starting guide](./start-here.md). Then,
learn how to play with `postgres` in the [build guide](./build-postgres.md).
After that, you can probe around a bit.
